Each of the subdirectories, or sub-modules, here contain all the code associated with a certain aspect of the manuscript associated with this repository ('Statistical Inference of a Convergent Antibody Repertoire Response to Influenza Vaccine'). Each of these sub-modules can be run separately (provided the input data is formatted correctly). Each sub-module tends to have many scripts within it, and one main script that will coordinate all the other scripts to run the entire task at hand from start to finish. This main script can be identified in the README file within each of these sub-modules. The sub-modules are as follows:

'pipeline' - This sub-module contains the bioinformatic pipeline that isolates Ab encoding reads from RNAseq data.
'FPCA_based_test_wrapper' - This is a small python wrapper for the R code from "More powerful significant testing for time course gene expression data using functional principal component analysis approaches", Wu and Wu, BMC Bioinformatics, 2013.
'convergent_gene_usage_test_global' - This sub-module contains the test for convergent gene usage across patients, when considering all the genes that seem to be responding to the stimulus simultaneously. In other words, this is a convergence test that uses information from all the genes together.
'convergent_gene_usage_test_indiv_genes' - This sub-module contains the gene usage convergence test for one gene at a time. In other words it runs a convergence test for each gene separately and independently.
